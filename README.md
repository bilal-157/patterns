- **Common Problems**:
  - Activity Selection.
  - Huffman Encoding.
  - Minimum Spanning Tree.
- **Start**: Solve "Coin Change Problem (Greedy)."

---

### **8. Graph Traversal**
- **Description**: Works with problems involving graph representations (BFS, DFS).
- **Common Problems**:
  - Detect cycles in a graph.
  - Shortest path in an unweighted graph.
  - Number of islands.
- **Start**: Implement BFS and DFS for a simple graph.

---

### **9. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**
- **Description**: Manages connected components.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Detect cycles in undirected graphs.
  - Kruskalâ€™s algorithm.
  - Number of connected components.
- **Start**: Solve "Find if graph is a tree."

---

### **10. Heap/Priority Queue**
- **Description**: Focuses on problems requiring quick access to the smallest/largest element.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Kth largest element.
  - Merge K sorted lists.
  - Top K frequent elements.
- **Start**: Solve "Find the Kth largest element in an array."

---

### **11. Bit Manipulation**
- **Description**: Solves problems using bitwise operations.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Single number in an array (XOR).
  - Counting set bits.
  - Subsets using bit masking.
- **Start**: Solve "Find the single number in an array where every other number appears twice."
